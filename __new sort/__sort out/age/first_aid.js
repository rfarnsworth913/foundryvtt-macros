/* This macro is specific to the AGE System (unoffical) game system.
 *
 * In AGE system games such as Modern AGE, The Expanse, etc., when a
 * character is reduced to 0 health they're not yet dead - it's more
 * like they've run out of luck. At that point any further damage
 * applied may be "bought off" by taking the injured condition if
 * they've not yet taken that condition, or the wounded condition
 * if they have already taken the injured condition. When taking
 * either injured or wounded, the character accounts for 1d6 points
 * of damage. Once wounded, any further damage will result in taking
 * the dying condition, at which point they will being to lose CON
 * points (1/round on their turn) until they reach -3, or until
 * someone successfully administers First Aid to stabalize them.
 * 
 * Use this macro if a character successfully applies First Aid
 * to a dying character to stabalize them and remove the dying
 * condition.
 * 
 * This macro requires that the game system be "age-system" so that
 * the actor will have the appropriate structure.
